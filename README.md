#Tinder for ride share

Ride Share is one of the most common option for daily commuters. Depending on the time of the ride, ride share can be cheaper by 5% to 25%. 
The problem with ride share is that the decision has to be made at the time of boarding the cab, and the user has no control on how much he could get delayed because of the shared ride.
Users typically prefer for ride share where there is a surge pricing due to increased demand causing an increase of the price and wait times.

Creates a problem of sharing a ride with someone who is not to your liking ðŸ˜Š 
We want to build an Tinder for Ride Share to solve this problem.
We match you with riders who can share your ride based on the wait times and cost savings

Let the users start their ride, and then choose other commuters who can SHARE the ride without increasing their travel time but still being able to SAVE some money by splitting the total bill with them.
At peak times where there is a shortage and higher price for cabâ€™s, people can check our app to request other users on their route for pickup by providing their pick up and drop locations and join them once they get the approvals from the other rider.
